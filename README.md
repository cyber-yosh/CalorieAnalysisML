# CalorieTracker

CalorieTracker is a lightweight AI-powered tool that estimates the calorie content of food from a single image. Just take a photo of a meal, and the model will output an estimated calorie value.

## Features

- Input: Photo of a food item or meal
- Output: Predicted calorie count
- Built using a custom-trained convolutional neural network

## Dataset

This project uses the [Nutrition5k dataset]([https://github.com/nutrition5k/nutrition5k](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Nutrition5k)) as the primary source for food images and corresponding nutritional values.
